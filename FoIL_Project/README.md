# Final Project: Reproducibility Challenge 

This is a project for a class at EPFL EE-441 "Fundamentals of inference and Learning"

This Repo is an attempt to reproduce the paper "Reconciling modern machine learning practice
and the bias-variance trade-of" As we found it interesting that faces one interesting topic, which is the double descent, and how the over-parametrization can help to solve machine learning problems.

In this repo the Experiments file has the main experiments and the results saved as .csv files of each result so that they can be analized furthermore.
